The modal for the mobile menu of the navigation block is closed by default only when the burger icon is clicked. This single-purpose-plugin adds a small Javascript snippet to the functionality so that the modal also closes when an area outside the menu is clicked.

* no bloat: single purpose plugin just doing it's job
